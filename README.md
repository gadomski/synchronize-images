# synchronize-images

A Rust executable to synchronize

- `SYNCHRO` file, as generated by Apps,
- A file containing image file names, one file name per line, and
- An SBET trajectory that has been converted to ASCII using [pdal](https://pdal.io).

Use this executable to match up event markers with, e.g., Hassleblad image file names.

## Usage

If you have an SBET file from Apps, you'll have to convert it to ASCII first, making sure to keep the appropriate precisions on each value:

```bash
pdal translate -i trajectory.xpf.out -o trajectory.txt \
    -r sbet \
    --writers.text.order="GpsTime:6,X:8,Y:8,Z:3,Roll:3,Pitch:3,Azimuth:3" \
    --writers.text.keep_unspecified=false
```

Then you can synchronize, piping the output to a text file:

```bash
synchronize-images syncro.xpf images.txt trajectory.txt > result.csv
```
